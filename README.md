# Deep-Agora
### Supervised by Prof. Dr. Jean-Yves RAMEL and conducted by Th√©o BOISSEAU - Polytech Tours


## Description:
Overhaul of Agora from the PaRADIIT Project: Analyzing Pattern Redundancy in texts of document images using Incremental Segmentation.

PaRADIIT is a project initiated and sponsored by 2 successive Google DH awards. It aims to turn ancient books, especially from the Renaissance, into accessible digital libraries.

The collaboration with the CESR resulted in the Agora software which simultaneously performs page layout analysis, text/graphics separation and pattern extraction. These patterns are then processed so that Retro extracts and groups similar patterns together in a single step. In this way, all the different patterns of a book can be extracted and analysed.

The objective of this project is to do a complete overhaul of the Agora software using a new approach oriented towards deep learning.
